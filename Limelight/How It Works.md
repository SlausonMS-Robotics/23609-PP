## How this is supposed to work
-----------------------------------------
1. The Limelight decodes the motif
2. It sends the tag ID to a variable
3. The Limelight can scan the classifier to figure out what color is next based on the variable with the tag ID
4. The robot then will, in theory, communicate with color sensors to find which tray has the next colored ball and launch it.
